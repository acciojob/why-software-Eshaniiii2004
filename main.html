	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that can help people in their daily lives. Technology has the power to create impact at a large scale, and I am motivated to learn continuously, improve my skills, and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
